The code expects two database files:

loansubmit.db    the "production" db
loansubmit_t.db  the test db

setup_schema.sql creates the tables expected -- it's destructive, so
be careful! Be sure to use sqlite3 (on my system, 'sqlite' by itself 
is version 2.x)

Set up the databases from scratch with:

sh$ sqlite3 loansubmit_t.db
sqlite> .read setup_schema.sql
sqlite> .quit

sh$ sqlite3 loansubmit.db
sqlite> .read setup_schema.sql
sqlite> .quit
